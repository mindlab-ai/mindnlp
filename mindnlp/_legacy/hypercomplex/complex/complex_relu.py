class ReLU(nn.Cell):
    r"""
    Rectified Linear Unit activation function for complex-valued input.

    Applies ReLU activation layer for the complex-valued input. This layer applies the element-wise
    :math:`\max(0, x)` for both real and imaginary parts of the input tensor independently:

     .. math::
        \begin{align}
        \text{Re(out)} = (Re(inp))^+ = \max(0, Re(inp))\\
        \text{Im(out)} = (Im(inp))^+ = \max(0, Im(inp)),
        \end{align}

    Inputs:
        - **inp** (Tensor) - The input of ReLU is a Tensor of shape (2, *, ..., *), with float16 or float32 data type,
          or (*, ..., *), with complex64 data type.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, with the same data type and shape as the `inp`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If dtype of `inp` is not float16, float32, or complex64.

        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
