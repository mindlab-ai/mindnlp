class ComplexAlgebraFactory(AlgebraFactory):

    r"""
    This class represents a factory for creating instances of complex algebra objects such as matrices, vectors, and scalars. 
    It provides methods to retrieve implementations for creating complex algebra objects. 
    The class inherits from AlgebraFactory and utilizes a common implementation for all types of complex algebra objects.
    """
    def get_matrix_impl(self) -> _MatrixImpl:
        r"""
        Retrieves the implementation of the matrix for complex algebra operations.
        
        Args:
            self: An instance of the ComplexAlgebraFactory class.
        
        Returns:
            An object of type _MatrixImpl, representing the implementation of the matrix for complex algebra operations.
        
        Raises:
            None.

        return _ComplexAlgebraImpl()

    def get_vector_impl(self) -> _VectorImpl:
        r"""
        Returns an instance of the _VectorImpl class that implements the complex algebra operations.
        
        Args:
            self: An instance of the ComplexAlgebraFactory class.
        
        Returns:
            An object of type _VectorImpl that provides the implementation for complex algebra operations.
        
        Raises:
            None.
        
        This method returns an instance of _VectorImpl, which is responsible for implementing the complex algebra operations for the ComplexAlgebraFactory class. The _VectorImpl class provides the necessary
functionality to perform vector operations in complex algebra. The returned object can be used to perform various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on complex numbers.
        
        Note that this method takes only one parameter, which is 'self'. 'self' represents the instance of the ComplexAlgebraFactory class itself and is used to access and manipulate its attributes and methods.
        
        Example usage:
            factory = ComplexAlgebraFactory()
            vector_impl = factory.get_vector_impl()
            vector_impl.add(complex(2, 3), complex(4, 5))  # Returns complex(6, 8)
            vector_impl.subtract(complex(2, 3), complex(4, 5))  # Returns complex(-2, -2)
            vector_impl.multiply(complex(2, 3), complex(4, 5))  # Returns complex(-7, 22)
            vector_impl.divide(complex(2, 3), complex(4, 5))  # Returns complex(0.56, 0.08)

        return _ComplexAlgebraImpl()

    def get_scalar_impl(self) -> _ScalarImpl:
        r"""
        This method retrieves the implementation of a scalar for the ComplexAlgebraFactory.
        
        Args:
            self (ComplexAlgebraFactory): The instance of the ComplexAlgebraFactory class.
                It is used to access the specific implementation of the scalar.
        
        Returns:
            _ScalarImpl: An instance of the _ScalarImpl class, representing the implementation of the scalar for the ComplexAlgebraFactory.
        
        Raises:
            None
