class _DualAlgebraImpl(_MatrixImpl, _VectorImpl, _ScalarImpl):

    r"""
    The _DualAlgebraImpl class represents a collection of methods for performing algebraic operations on dual numbers. 
    These operations include multiplication, division, matrix multiplication, dot product, square root, handling special elements, visiting elements, and performing scalar operations. 
    This class inherits from _MatrixImpl, _VectorImpl, _ScalarImpl, and provides an implementation for each method to handle dual numbers and perform the corresponding algebraic operations on them.
