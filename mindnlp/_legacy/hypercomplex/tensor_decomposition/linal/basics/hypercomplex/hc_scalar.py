class Scalar(AbstractScalar):

    r"""
    The Scalar class represents a scalar value in an algebraic system. It provides methods for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as functionality for
obtaining the square root, converting to an array, checking if the value is zero, and accessing the real component. The class also includes static methods for creating scalar instances representing zero and
one.

        _x (np.float64): The real component of the scalar value.
        _y (np.float64): The imaginary component of the scalar value.
    
    Methods:
        __str__(): Returns a string representation of the scalar value.

        __mul__(that: 'Scalar'): Returns the result of multiplying the current scalar by another scalar.
        __truediv__(that: 'Scalar'): Returns the result of dividing the current scalar by another scalar.
        __getitem__(key): Returns the real or imaginary component of the scalar based on the provided key.
        sqrt(): Returns the square root of the scalar value.

        is_zero(): Checks if the scalar value is effectively zero within a tolerance.
        get_real(): Returns the real component of the scalar value.
        visit(visitor, *args, **kwargs): Invokes a visitor function with optional arguments and keyword arguments.
        _make_like(val: Tuple[np.float64, np.float64]): Creates a new scalar instance with the same algebra factory as the current instance based on the provided values.
        _zero_like(): Creates a new scalar instance representing zero with the same algebra factory as the current instance.
