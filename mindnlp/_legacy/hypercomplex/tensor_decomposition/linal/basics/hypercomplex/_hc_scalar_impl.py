class _ScalarImpl(ABC):

    r"""Python class representing the implementation of a scalar.
    
    This class, '_ScalarImpl', is an implementation of a scalar that inherits from the ABC (Abstract Base Class). 
    The class provides several abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass. These methods include 'sqrt', 'special_element', 'visit', 'mul_scalar', and 'div_scalar'.
    
    The 'sqrt' method takes two arguments, 'x' and 'y', both of type np.float64, and returns a tuple of two np.float64 values. This method calculates the square root of the given values.
    
    The 'special_element' method does not take any arguments and returns a string. This method should be implemented to return a special element associated with the scalar implementation.
    
    The 'visit' method takes a 'scalar' argument, a 'visitor' argument, and optional additional arguments and keyword arguments. It does not return anything. This method is used to visit the scalar value and perform certain operations using the provided 'visitor' object.
    
    The 'mul_scalar' method takes four arguments, 'x1', 'y1', 'x2', and 'y2', all of type np.float64, and returns a tuple of two np.float64 values. This method performs multiplication of two scalar values.
    
    The 'div_scalar' method takes four arguments, 'x1', 'y1', 'x2', and 'y2', all of type np.float64, and returns a tuple of two np.float64 values. This method performs division of two scalar values.
    
    Subclasses of '_ScalarImpl' must implement all of these abstract methods to provide the necessary functionality for working with the scalar implementation.
    
    Note: This class does not provide any implementation details for the abstract methods, as they are meant to be implemented by the subclasses.
