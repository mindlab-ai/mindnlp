class Scalar(ABC):

    r"""
    Represents a scalar value and provides abstract methods for mathematical operations and transformations.
    
    This class inherits from ABC and defines abstract methods for arithmetic operations, square root, visitor pattern, creating new instances with the same type, getting the scalar as a NumPy array, checking
if the scalar is zero, and getting the real value as a NumPy float64.
    
    Subclasses of 'Scalar' must implement these abstract methods to define the behavior of scalar values in their specific contexts.
