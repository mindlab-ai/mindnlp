        This method applies the Householder transformation to the input matrix 'm'. The Householder transformation is used in 
        numerical linear algebra to reduce a matrix to upper triangular form through a series of orthogonal transformations.
        
        The Householder transformation is computed by iterating over the columns of the matrix and performing the following steps:
        1. Calculate the reflection vector 'v' using the Householder algorithm.
        2. Construct the Householder matrix 'q_k' using the reflection vector 'v'.
        3. Update the matrix 'q' by multiplying it with 'q_k'.
        4. Update the matrix 'r' by multiplying it with 'q_k'.
        
        The Householder transformation is useful in various applications such as solving systems of linear equations, 
        least squares problems, and eigenvalue computations.
        
        Note:
        - The input matrix 'm' should be a valid instance of the 'Matrix' class.
        - The method does not modify the input matrix 'm' directly, but instead returns two transformed matrices 'q' and 'r'.
        - The matrices 'q' and 'r' represent the orthogonal and upper triangular forms respectively.
        
        Example:
            m = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
            qr = QR()

        Args:

        Raises:

        The Gram-Schmidt process is used to orthogonalize a set of vectors in a given matrix. This process takes the input matrix and produces a new matrix where each column vector is orthogonal to all the previous column vectors. The resulting vectors are normalized to have a length of 1.
        
        The method starts by initializing a normalized matrix and a projections matrix. It then iterates over each column in the input matrix. For each column, it calculates the corresponding vector and performs the following steps:
        - If it's not the first column, it calculates the projection of the vector onto the previous normalized vectors.
        - It then calculates the squared length of the vector and its actual length.
        - The vector is then divided by its length to normalize it.
        - The normalized vector is concatenated to the normalized matrix.
        - If there are more columns, it calculates the dot products between the normalized vector and the remaining columns in the input matrix.
        - The dot products are adjusted and concatenated to the projections matrix.
        
        Finally, the method returns the resulting normalized matrix after the Gram-Schmidt process.
        
        Note: This method is a static method and should be called using the class name, followed by the method name.
