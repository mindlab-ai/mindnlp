# MindNLP

## Introduction

MindNLP is an open source natural language processing (NLP) library based on MindSpore. 

It aims to reduce common and repeated code in the procedures of NLP, and provides easy-to-use APIs to help developers accomplish NLP tasks faster.

The master branch of MindNLP works with **MindSpore master**.
